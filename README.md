# Planning Poker 

Planning Poker is a consensus-based estimating technique that development teams use to estimate the effort of each user story.
These estimations are based on the entire teamâ€™s input and consensus, it's achieved by playing numbered cards face-down to the table.
The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed until a consensus reached.
